@duck-lox(rs)
============

There are several implementations of the "Lox" programming language, 
These implementations can be different than this implementation,
But you figure out how it works by checking the guide i will create 
after i get done with this.


In order to build use ``cargo build`` or
``cargo build --release``.  

There will be a documentation of this language after i get done, so do not worry.

Stages i am following : 
  - [x] diagnostic
  - [x] scanner
  - [x] parser
  - [x] interputer
