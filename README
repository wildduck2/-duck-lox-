============

There are several implementations of the "Lox" programming language, 
These implementations can vary in their features,
But you figure out how it works by checking the guide that will be provided after the implementation.


> NOTE: the purpose of this repository is to provide a full implementation of the Lox programming
language in many different paths.
> These languages at the moment are not for any production use, or even for learning purposes, thus 
there is not docs for it right now.
> INFO: later one will be added.
