## Study Notes: Chapter 7: Evaluating Expressions

### 1. The Goal: An Interpreter That "Executes"

This is the chapter where our interpreter "comes alive." âš¡ The goal is to take the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the parser and execute it. Since we only have expressions, "executing" means **evaluating** them to produce a final, single **value**.

### 2. Key Challenge 1: Representing Lox Values

How do we represent Lox's dynamically-typed values (numbers, strings, booleans, nil) inside our statically-typed Java interpreter?

* **The Problem:** A Lox variable can hold a `number`, then a `string`, then `nil`. A Java variable cannot.
* **The Solution:** We will use the Java "root" class, `java.lang.Object`, as the single static type for all Lox values.
* **Mapping:**
    * Lox `number` $\rightarrow$ Java `Double`
    * Lox `string` $\rightarrow$ Java `String`
    * Lox `Boolean` $\rightarrow$ Java `Boolean`
    * Lox `nil` $\rightarrow$ Java `null`
* **Dynamic Typing:** We will use Java's `instanceof` operator to check the *runtime* type of an `Object`. This is the core mechanism we'll use to implement Lox's dynamic typing.

---

### 3. Key Challenge 2: Organizing the Evaluation Code

How do we write the code to evaluate each `Expr` type?

* **The Strategy:** We will **not** use the "Interpreter Pattern" (i.e., adding an `interpret()` method to each `Expr` subclass). This would "smush" different concerns (like parsing, resolving, and interpreting) into the same files.
* **The Solution:** We will reuse the **Visitor Pattern** from Chapter 5.
* **Implementation:**
    1.  We create a new class: `Interpreter`.
    2.  This class implements `Expr.Visitor<Object>`.
    3.  The generic type `Object` signifies that every `visit...()` method will return a Lox value (represented as a Java `Object`).
    4.  Instead of building a string (like `AstPrinter`), the visit methods will perform computations and return the resulting value.

---

### 4. Implementation: Visiting the `Expr` Nodes

Evaluation is a **post-order traversal**: we evaluate an expression's children (operands) first, then we evaluate the expression itself.

* **`evaluate(Expr expr)`:** A simple helper method that just calls `expr.accept(this)`. This is the "recursive step" of the interpreter.
* **`visitLiteralExpr(Expr.Literal expr)`:** The base case. This is the simplest to evaluate: it just returns the value that the parser already stored (e.g., `123`, `"hello"`).
* **`visitGroupingExpr(Expr.Grouping expr)`:** Also simple. It just recursively calls `evaluate()` on the expression *inside* the parentheses.
* **`visitUnaryExpr(Expr.Unary expr)`:**
    1.  First, recursively `evaluate()` the right-hand operand.
    2.  `switch` on the operator:
        * **`-` (Negation):** Casts the operand to a `(double)` and negates it.
        * **`!` (Logical Not):** This introduces the concept of "truthiness."

---

### 5. Core Concept: Truthiness and Falsiness

The `!` operator (and later, `if` statements) needs to decide if a value is "true" or "false."

* **The Rule:** Lox follows Ruby's simple rule: **`nil` and `false` are "falsey."**
* **Everything Else:** All other values (numbers, strings, `true`, etc.) are "truthy."
* **Implementation:** This logic is encapsulated in a private helper method: `isTruthy(Object object)`.

---

### 6. Implementation: Binary Expressions

* **Evaluation Order:** The interpreter *first* calls `evaluate(expr.left)`, and *then* calls `evaluate(expr.right)`. This formally defines Lox's **left-to-right evaluation order**.
* **`visitBinaryExpr(Expr.Binary expr)`:** A `switch` on the operator:
    * **Arithmetic (`-`, `*`, `/`):** Evaluate both operands, cast them to `(double)`, and perform the math.
    * **Comparisons (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`):** Evaluate both operands, cast them to `(double)`, perform the comparison, and return a `Boolean`.
    * **Equality (`==`, `!=`):** These operators work on *all* types.
        * Uses a helper `isEqual(Object a, Object b)`.
        * This helper correctly handles `null` (for `nil`) and then uses Java's built-in `.equals()` method.
    * **Special Case (`+`):** This operator is **overloaded**.
        * If *both* operands are `Double`s, it performs **addition**.
        * If *both* operands are `String`s, it performs **concatenation**.

### 7. Handling Runtime Errors

What happens if the user tries to run `-"muffin"`? Java will throw a `ClassCastException`, which is an ugly implementation detail we must hide.

* **The Problem:** A raw Java exception (like `ClassCastException`) crashes the interpreter and exposes its internal workings (Java) to the Lox user.
* **The Goal:** We must detect, report, and gracefully handle these errors as **Lox runtime errors**.
* **The Solution (A 3-Step Process):**
    1.  **Check Before Casting:** We add helper methods (e.g., `checkNumberOperand(Token, Object)`) that `instanceof` check an operand's type *before* we try to cast it.
    2.  **Throw Custom Exception:** If the type check fails, we `throw` a new, custom exception: `RuntimeError`.
    3.  **`RuntimeError` Class:** We create a new `RuntimeError` class that extends `RuntimeException` but also stores the `Token` that caused the error. This is crucial for reporting the **line number** of the error to the user.

---

### 8. Hooking Up the Interpreter

We wire the new `Interpreter` into the main `Lox.java` class.

* **Public API:** We add a public `interpret(Expr expression)` method to the `Interpreter` class.
* **Error Handling:** This `interpret` method wraps the call to `evaluate()` inside a `try...catch` block.
    * **On Success:** It prints the resulting value.
    * **On Failure:** It `catch`es the `RuntimeError` and passes it to `Lox.runtimeError()` to be reported.
* **`stringify(Object object)`:** A new helper method that converts a Lox value (as a Java `Object`) back into a user-friendly string (e.g., Java `null` becomes Lox `"nil"`, and `123.0` becomes `"123"`).
* **Exit Codes:** The `Lox` class now tracks a `hadRuntimeError` flag to exit with code `70` if a runtime error occurs in a script.

---

### 9. Design Note: Static and Dynamic Typing

* **The Topic:** Lox is **dynamically typed** (checks types at runtime), while Java is **statically typed** (checks types at compile time).
* **Key Insight:** This is a **continuum**, not a black-and-white choice.
* **The Proof:** Even "statically typed" languages like Java still perform many *runtime* type checks (e.g., `ClassCastException` on a downcast, or `ArrayStoreException` when putting the wrong type into an `Object[]` that is *really* an `Integer[]`).
* **The Trade-off:** Language designers (like Java's) often trade perfect static safety for more programmer flexibility (like covariant arrays).
