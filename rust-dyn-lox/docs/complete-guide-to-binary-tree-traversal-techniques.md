# Complete Guide to Binary Tree Traversal Techniques

## Chapter 1: Understanding Trees and Why We Traverse Them

### What is a Binary Tree?

Before we dive into traversal techniques, let's establish a solid foundation. A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child. Think of it like a family tree, but each person can have only up to two children.

Unlike linear data structures such as arrays or linked lists where elements are arranged in a sequence, trees organize data in a hierarchical manner. This organization makes them incredibly powerful for representing relationships and hierarchies that naturally occur in real-world problems.

### Why Do We Need Different Traversal Methods?

You might wonder: why can't we just visit nodes in one standard way? The answer lies in the different problems we need to solve. Different traversal orders give us different perspectives on the same tree structure, and each perspective is useful for different purposes.

Consider this analogy: imagine you're organizing books on shelves. You might organize them alphabetically (one order), by genre (another order), or by publication date (yet another order). Each organization method serves a different purpose, even though the books themselves haven't changed. Tree traversals work similarly—they give us different ways to "read" the same tree structure.

### The Structure of a Tree Node

Every journey through a tree begins with understanding what makes up a tree node. At its core, a node contains three essential pieces of information:

1. **The data itself**: This could be a number, a string, or any other type of information
2. **A reference to the left child**: This could be another node or nothing at all
3. **A reference to the right child**: Similarly, this could be another node or nothing

When a node has no children, we call it a **leaf node**. When a node has no parent (it's at the very top), we call it the **root node**. All other nodes are called **internal nodes**.

## Chapter 2: The Foundation - Recursive Tree Traversal

### Understanding Recursion in Trees

Recursion is the natural way to think about trees because trees are recursive structures by definition. What does this mean? Well, any tree can be thought of as a root node with two subtrees attached to it. Each of those subtrees is itself a tree with its own root and subtrees. This pattern continues all the way down to the leaf nodes.

This recursive nature means that any operation we can perform on the entire tree, we can also perform on any subtree. This is the key insight that makes recursive tree traversal so elegant and powerful.

### The Three Fundamental Depth-First Traversals

Depth-first traversals explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Imagine you're in a maze—a depth-first approach would mean following one path all the way to its end before trying a different path. There are three main types, differing only in when we "visit" (process) each node relative to its children.

---

## Chapter 3: Inorder Traversal (Left → Root → Right)

### The Concept

Inorder traversal follows a simple but powerful pattern: for every node, we first explore everything in its left subtree, then we visit the node itself, and finally we explore everything in its right subtree. The name "inorder" comes from the fact that for binary search trees, this traversal visits nodes in ascending order.

### Why Inorder Matters

The most important property of inorder traversal is that when applied to a Binary Search Tree (BST), it produces a sorted sequence. This is because in a BST, all values in the left subtree are smaller than the root, and all values in the right subtree are larger. By visiting left first, then root, then right, we naturally visit values in increasing order.

### Recursive Implementation in Rust

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

// Define our tree node structure
// We use Rc (Reference Counted) and RefCell to allow multiple ownership
// and interior mutability in a memory-safe way
#[derive(Debug)]
struct TreeNode {
    val: i32,
    left: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>,
    right: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>,
}

impl TreeNode {
    // Constructor to create a new node
    fn new(val: i32) -> Rc<RefCell<Self>> {
        Rc::new(RefCell::new(TreeNode {
            val,
            left: None,
            right: None,
        }))
    }
}

// Inorder traversal: Left -> Root -> Right
fn inorder_traversal(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>, result: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    // Base case: if the node doesn't exist, return immediately
    if let Some(node) = root {
        let node_borrowed = node.borrow();
        
        // Step 1: Recursively traverse the left subtree
        // This ensures all left descendants are visited first
        inorder_traversal(node_borrowed.left.clone(), result);
        
        // Step 2: Visit the current node
        // At this point, all left descendants have been processed
        result.push(node_borrowed.val);
        
        // Step 3: Recursively traverse the right subtree
        // This ensures all right descendants are visited last
        inorder_traversal(node_borrowed.right.clone(), result);
    }
}

// Helper function to perform inorder traversal
fn inorder(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    inorder_traversal(root, &mut result);
    result
}
```

### Understanding the Code

Let's break down what's happening here. When we call `inorder_traversal` on a node, three things happen in sequence:

First, we make a recursive call on the left child. This call doesn't return until the entire left subtree has been processed. Think of it as diving deep into the left side of the tree, all the way to the leftmost node, before doing anything else.

Second, once the left subtree is completely processed, we visit the current node by adding its value to our result list. At this moment, we know for certain that all nodes that should come before this node (in the left subtree) have already been added to our result.

Third, we make a recursive call on the right child. This processes the entire right subtree. By the time this returns, we've processed the current node and all its descendants.

### Iterative Implementation Using a Stack

While recursion is elegant, it's important to understand that recursion uses the call stack behind the scenes. We can make this explicit by using our own stack data structure:

```rust
fn inorder_iterative(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    let mut stack = Vec::new();
    let mut current = root;
    
    // Continue while we have nodes to process
    while current.is_some() || !stack.is_empty() {
        // Go as far left as possible, pushing nodes onto the stack
        while let Some(node) = current {
            stack.push(node.clone());
            current = node.borrow().left.clone();
        }
        
        // We've reached the leftmost node, so process it
        if let Some(node) = stack.pop() {
            result.push(node.borrow().val);
            // Move to the right subtree
            current = node.borrow().right.clone();
        }
    }
    
    result
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of inorder traversal is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Why? Because we visit each node exactly once, and at each node we perform a constant amount of work (pushing to a vector).

The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack (or explicit stack in iterative version). In the worst case of a completely skewed tree (essentially a linked list), h equals n, giving us O(n) space. In the best case of a perfectly balanced tree, h equals log(n), giving us O(log n) space.

## Chapter 4: Preorder Traversal (Root → Left → Right)

### The Concept

Preorder traversal changes the order: we visit the root first, then recursively traverse the left subtree, and finally traverse the right subtree. The name "preorder" indicates that we process the root before (pre-) its children.

### Why Preorder Matters

Preorder traversal is particularly useful when you want to create a copy of the tree or when you want to get a prefix expression from an expression tree. It's also the natural order for serializing a tree—if you wanted to write a tree to a file and later reconstruct it, preorder gives you a sensible sequence.

Think about it this way: when you describe a tree to someone, you often start with "The root is 5, it has a left child of 3, which has..." This is preorder thinking—root first, then children.

### Recursive Implementation

```rust
fn preorder_traversal(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>, result: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    if let Some(node) = root {
        let node_borrowed = node.borrow();
        
        // Step 1: Visit the root first
        // This is the key difference from inorder
        result.push(node_borrowed.val);
        
        // Step 2: Traverse left subtree
        preorder_traversal(node_borrowed.left.clone(), result);
        
        // Step 3: Traverse right subtree
        preorder_traversal(node_borrowed.right.clone(), result);
    }
}

fn preorder(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    preorder_traversal(root, &mut result);
    result
}
```

### Iterative Implementation

```rust
fn preorder_iterative(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    if root.is_none() {
        return result;
    }
    
    let mut stack = vec![root.unwrap()];
    
    while let Some(node) = stack.pop() {
        // Visit the node immediately when we pop it
        result.push(node.borrow().val);
        
        // Push right child first (so it's processed second)
        if let Some(right) = node.borrow().right.clone() {
            stack.push(right);
        }
        
        // Push left child second (so it's processed first)
        if let Some(left) = node.borrow().left.clone() {
            stack.push(left);
        }
    }
    
    result
}
```

### Understanding the Iterative Approach

The iterative preorder is actually simpler than inorder's iterative version. Why? Because we process each node as soon as we encounter it, then push its children onto the stack for later processing. The key trick is pushing the right child before the left child, because stacks are LIFO (Last In, First Out), so the last thing we push is the first thing we pop.

---

## Chapter 5: Postorder Traversal (Left → Right → Root)

### The Concept

Postorder traversal saves the root for last. We traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally visit the root. The name "postorder" indicates we process the root after (post-) its children.

### Why Postorder Matters

Postorder traversal is essential for tree deletion. Why? Because you need to delete children before you delete their parent. If you deleted the parent first, you'd lose all references to the children and create a memory leak.

It's also used to evaluate expression trees. In an expression tree, operators are internal nodes and operands are leaves. To evaluate an expression, you need to evaluate both operands before applying the operator—exactly what postorder gives you.

### Recursive Implementation

```rust
fn postorder_traversal(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>, result: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    if let Some(node) = root {
        let node_borrowed = node.borrow();
        
        // Step 1: Traverse left subtree
        postorder_traversal(node_borrowed.left.clone(), result);
        
        // Step 2: Traverse right subtree
        postorder_traversal(node_borrowed.right.clone(), result);
        
        // Step 3: Visit root last
        // At this point, all descendants have been processed
        result.push(node_borrowed.val);
    }
}

fn postorder(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    postorder_traversal(root, &mut result);
    result
}
```

### Iterative Implementation (Two Stacks Method)

```rust
fn postorder_iterative_two_stacks(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    if root.is_none() {
        return result;
    }
    
    let mut stack1 = vec![root.unwrap()];
    let mut stack2 = Vec::new();
    
    // First stack processes nodes in Root-Right-Left order
    while let Some(node) = stack1.pop() {
        stack2.push(node.clone());
        
        // Push left first, then right (opposite of preorder)
        if let Some(left) = node.borrow().left.clone() {
            stack1.push(left);
        }
        if let Some(right) = node.borrow().right.clone() {
            stack1.push(right);
        }
    }
    
    // Second stack reverses to give us Left-Right-Root
    while let Some(node) = stack2.pop() {
        result.push(node.borrow().val);
    }
    
    result
}
```

### Iterative Implementation (One Stack Method)

```rust
fn postorder_iterative_one_stack(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    if root.is_none() {
        return result;
    }
    
    let mut stack = Vec::new();
    let mut current = root;
    let mut last_visited: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>> = None;
    
    while current.is_some() || !stack.is_empty() {
        // Go as far left as possible
        while let Some(node) = current {
            stack.push(node.clone());
            current = node.borrow().left.clone();
        }
        
        // Peek at the top of stack
        if let Some(peek_node) = stack.last() {
            let right = peek_node.borrow().right.clone();
            
            // If right child exists and hasn't been visited, go right
            if right.is_some() && 
               (last_visited.is_none() || 
                !Rc::ptr_eq(&right.as_ref().unwrap(), &last_visited.as_ref().unwrap())) {
                current = right;
            } else {
                // Visit the node
                let node = stack.pop().unwrap();
                result.push(node.borrow().val);
                last_visited = Some(node);
            }
        }
    }
    
    result
}
```

### Understanding the One-Stack Method

This is the most complex iterative traversal. We need to track which nodes we've already visited (specifically, which right children we've processed) to avoid infinite loops. The key insight is that we can only visit a node after we've visited both its left and right subtrees. We use the `last_visited` variable to determine whether we've already processed a node's right child.

## Chapter 6: Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search)

### The Concept

Level order traversal takes a completely different approach. Instead of going deep into one branch (depth-first), it processes all nodes at the same level before moving to the next level. It's like reading a book from top to bottom, left to right, line by line.

### Why Level Order Matters

Level order traversal is useful for many problems:
- Finding the maximum or minimum value at each level
- Calculating the width of a tree
- Serializing and deserializing trees level by level
- Finding the shortest path between nodes (since we process closer nodes first)

### Implementation Using a Queue

```rust
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn level_order(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> Vec<Vec<i32>> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    if root.is_none() {
        return result;
    }
    
    // Use a queue for BFS (First In, First Out)
    let mut queue = VecDeque::new();
    queue.push_back(root.unwrap());
    
    while !queue.is_empty() {
        let level_size = queue.len();
        let mut current_level = Vec::new();
        
        // Process all nodes at the current level
        for _ in 0..level_size {
            if let Some(node) = queue.pop_front() {
                current_level.push(node.borrow().val);
                
                // Add children to queue for next level
                if let Some(left) = node.borrow().left.clone() {
                    queue.push_back(left);
                }
                if let Some(right) = node.borrow().right.clone() {
                    queue.push_back(right);
                }
            }
        }
        
        result.push(current_level);
    }
    
    result
}
```

### Understanding the Algorithm

The key to level order traversal is using a queue instead of a stack. A queue is FIFO (First In, First Out), which means we process nodes in the order we discover them. This naturally gives us level-by-level processing.

We also track the size of the queue at the start of each level. This tells us exactly how many nodes are at the current level, allowing us to process them as a group.

### Single-List Level Order

Sometimes we don't need to separate nodes by level:

```rust
fn level_order_simple(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    if root.is_none() {
        return result;
    }
    
    let mut queue = VecDeque::new();
    queue.push_back(root.unwrap());
    
    while let Some(node) = queue.pop_front() {
        result.push(node.borrow().val);
        
        if let Some(left) = node.borrow().left.clone() {
            queue.push_back(left);
        }
        if let Some(right) = node.borrow().right.clone() {
            queue.push_back(right);
        }
    }
    
    result
}
```

---

## Chapter 7: Advanced Traversals - Boundary and Diagonal

### Boundary Traversal

Boundary traversal visits only the "outline" of the tree: the left boundary (excluding leaves), all leaf nodes, and the right boundary (excluding leaves, in reverse order).

```rust
fn boundary_traversal(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    if root.is_none() {
        return result;
    }
    
    let root_node = root.unwrap();
    
    // Add root if it's not a leaf
    if !is_leaf(&root_node) {
        result.push(root_node.borrow().val);
    }
    
    // Add left boundary (top to bottom, excluding leaves)
    add_left_boundary(&root_node, &mut result);
    
    // Add all leaves (left to right)
    add_leaves(&Some(root_node.clone()), &mut result);
    
    // Add right boundary (bottom to top, excluding leaves)
    add_right_boundary(&root_node, &mut result);
    
    result
}

fn is_leaf(node: &Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>) -> bool {
    let borrowed = node.borrow();
    borrowed.left.is_none() && borrowed.right.is_none()
}

fn add_left_boundary(node: &Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>, result: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    let mut current = node.borrow().left.clone();
    
    while let Some(node) = current {
        if !is_leaf(&node) {
            result.push(node.borrow().val);
        }
        
        // Move to the leftmost available child
        let borrowed = node.borrow();
        current = if borrowed.left.is_some() {
            borrowed.left.clone()
        } else {
            borrowed.right.clone()
        };
    }
}

fn add_leaves(node: &Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>, result: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    if let Some(n) = node {
        if is_leaf(n) {
            result.push(n.borrow().val);
        } else {
            add_leaves(&n.borrow().left.clone(), result);
            add_leaves(&n.borrow().right.clone(), result);
        }
    }
}

fn add_right_boundary(node: &Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>, result: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    let mut stack = Vec::new();
    let mut current = node.borrow().right.clone();
    
    while let Some(node) = current {
        if !is_leaf(&node) {
            stack.push(node.borrow().val);
        }
        
        // Move to the rightmost available child
        let borrowed = node.borrow();
        current = if borrowed.right.is_some() {
            borrowed.right.clone()
        } else {
            borrowed.left.clone()
        };
    }
    
    // Add in reverse order (bottom to top)
    while let Some(val) = stack.pop() {
        result.push(val);
    }
}
```

### Understanding Boundary Traversal

Boundary traversal is like tracing the outline of the tree with your finger. You start at the root, go down the left edge (but don't include leaf nodes yet), then collect all the leaf nodes from left to right, and finally go up the right edge.

The trick is handling the three parts separately and being careful not to duplicate nodes (especially the root and leaves).

### Diagonal Traversal

Diagonal traversal groups nodes that lie on the same diagonal line, where a diagonal is defined as a path that goes down-right repeatedly.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn diagonal_traversal(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> Vec<Vec<i32>> {
    let mut diagonals: HashMap<i32, Vec<i32>> = HashMap::new();
    
    // Helper function to populate diagonals
    fn traverse(
        node: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>, 
        diagonal: i32, 
        diagonals: &mut HashMap<i32, Vec<i32>>
    ) {
        if let Some(n) = node {
            let borrowed = n.borrow();
            
            // Add current node to its diagonal
            diagonals.entry(diagonal)
                     .or_insert_with(Vec::new)
                     .push(borrowed.val);
            
            // Left child increases the diagonal number
            traverse(borrowed.left.clone(), diagonal + 1, diagonals);
            
            // Right child stays on the same diagonal
            traverse(borrowed.right.clone(), diagonal, diagonals);
        }
    }
    
    traverse(root, 0, &mut diagonals);
    
    // Convert HashMap to sorted vector
    let mut result: Vec<_> = diagonals.into_iter().collect();
    result.sort_by_key(|&(k, _)| k);
    result.into_iter().map(|(_, v)| v).collect()
}
```

### Understanding Diagonal Traversal

Think of diagonals as sliding down and to the right. When you can go right, you stay on the same diagonal. When you must go left, you move to the next diagonal. This creates groups of nodes that form diagonal lines through the tree.

## Chapter 8: Practical Applications and Use Cases

### Binary Search Tree Validation

```rust
fn is_valid_bst(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> bool {
    // Use inorder traversal to check if values are in ascending order
    let values = inorder(root);
    
    for i in 1..values.len() {
        if values[i] <= values[i - 1] {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    true
}
```

### Tree Serialization and Deserialization

```rust
fn serialize(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> String {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    
    fn preorder_serialize(
        node: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>, 
        result: &mut Vec<String>

### Finding Maximum Width of Tree

```rust
fn max_width(root: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>) -> i32 {
    if root.is_none() {
        return 0;
    }
    
    let mut max_width = 0;
    let mut queue = VecDeque::new();
    queue.push_back(root.unwrap());
    
    while !queue.is_empty() {
        let level_size = queue.len();
        max_width = max_width.max(level_size as i32);
        
        for _ in 0..level_size {
            if let Some(node) = queue.pop_front() {
                if let Some(left) = node.borrow().left.clone() {
                    queue.push_back(left);
                }
                if let Some(right) = node.borrow().right.clone() {
                    queue.push_back(right);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    max_width
}
```

Here's a complete program that demonstrates all traversal techniques:

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::collections::VecDeque;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct TreeNode {
    val: i32,
    left: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>,
    right: Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>,
}

impl TreeNode {
    fn new(val: i32) -> Rc<RefCell<Self>> {
        Rc::new(RefCell::new(TreeNode {
            val,
            left: None,
            right: None,
        }))
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Build example tree:
    //        1
    //       / \
    //      2   3
    //     / \   \
    //    4   5   6
    
    let root = TreeNode::new(1);
    let node2 = TreeNode::new(2);
    let node3 = TreeNode::new(3);
    let node4 = TreeNode::new(4);
    let node5 = TreeNode::new(5);
    let node6 = TreeNode::new(6);
    
    root.borrow_mut().left = Some(node2.clone());
    root.borrow_mut().right = Some(node3.clone());
    node2.borrow_mut().left = Some(node4);
    node2.borrow_mut().right = Some(node5);
    node3.borrow_mut().right = Some(node6);
    
    println!("Tree structure:");
    println!("       1");
    println!("      / \\");
    println!("     2   3");
    println!("    / \\   \\");
    println!("   4   5   6");
    println!();
    
    println!("Inorder (Left-Root-Right): {:?}", inorder(Some(root.clone())));
    println!("Expected: [4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 6]");
    println!();
    
    println!("Preorder (Root-Left-Right): {:?}", preorder(Some(root.clone())));
    println!("Expected: [1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6]");
    println!();
    
    println!("Postorder (Left-Right-Root): {:?}", postorder(Some(root.clone())));
    println!("Expected: [4, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1]");
    println!();
    
    println!("Level Order: {:?}", level_order(Some(root.clone())));
    println!("Expected: [[1], [2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]");
}

## Chapter 10: Performance Analysis and Best Practices

### Time Complexity Summary

All basic traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order) have the same time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes. This is optimal because we must visit each node at least once to traverse the entire tree.

### Space Complexity Comparison

The space complexity varies depending on the tree structure:

**Recursive Traversals:**
- Best case (balanced tree): O(log n) - the height of a balanced tree
- Worst case (skewed tree): O(n) - when the tree degenerates into a linked list

**Iterative Traversals:**
- Same as recursive, but the space is used by an explicit stack/queue rather than the call stack

**Level Order Traversal:**
- Best case: O(1) - when the tree is completely skewed
- Worst case: O(n) - when the last level is completely full (can contain n/2 nodes)

### When to Use Each Traversal

**Inorder:**
- Retrieving elements from a BST in sorted order
- Validating that a tree is a valid BST
- Finding the kth smallest element in a BST

**Preorder:**
- Creating a copy of the tree
- Getting prefix notation from an expression tree
- Serializing a tree structure

**Postorder:**
- Deleting a tree (children before parents)
- Getting postfix notation from an expression tree
- Calculating directory sizes in a file system

**Level Order:**
- Finding shortest path between nodes
- Printing tree level by level
- Checking if a tree is complete
- Finding maximum width

### Best Practices

**Memory Management in Rust:**
Rust's ownership system prevents memory leaks, but you still need to be careful with reference cycles when building trees. Using `Rc<RefCell<>>` is common for trees, but be aware it has runtime overhead.

**Choosing Between Recursive and Iterative:**
- Use recursive when code clarity is more important and stack space isn't a concern
- Use iterative when dealing with very deep trees or when you need precise control over memory usage

**Error Handling:**
In production code, always handle edge cases:
- Empty trees (None/null root)
- Single-node trees
- Completely skewed trees
- Very deep trees (potential stack overflow with recursion)

## Conclusion

Tree traversal is a fundamental skill in computer science and software engineering. Each traversal method gives you a different perspective on the tree structure, and understanding when to use each one is key to solving tree-related problems efficiently.

The recursive implementations are elegant and easy to understand, making them perfect for learning and for situations where the tree depth is limited. The iterative implementations, while more complex, give you explicit control over memory usage and avoid potential stack overflow issues.

As you practice with trees, you'll develop an intuition for which traversal to use for different problems. The patterns you've learned here—depth-first vs breadth-first, the order of visiting nodes, using stacks vs queues—are fundamental concepts that appear throughout computer science and will serve you well beyond just tree problems.

Remember: trees are recursive structures, so think recursively even when implementing iteratively. Each node is the root of its own subtree, and any operation on the whole tree can be thought of as an operation on the root plus recursive operations on the subtrees.
