Change Log
----------
2025-11-10
- Extended the expression parser through unary, factor, cast, shift, and bitwise layers, keeping 
  the AST updates and grouped-expression handling in sync.
- Fixed the lexer `match` helper so it no longer skips characters when matching punctuation-heavy 
  tokens.

2025-11-09
- Completed primary expression coverage by wiring identifiers, booleans, postfix operators, and 
  string/float literals between the lexer and parser.
- Refined literal scanning (float/integer unification, suffix guards, empty-line comment recovery)
  to harden the lexer’s edge cases.
- Polished developer feedback with severity color fixes plus refreshed BNF grammar notes and the 
  AST print tree output.

2025-11-08
- Added unified numeric literal suffix scanning (integers `u8`/`i32` etc. and floats `f32`/`f64`)
  across every base, plus diagnostics for malformed suffixes and reserved prefixes.
- Introduced lifetime lexing (`'a`, `'static`, `'_`) with invalid-number detection, integrating 
  it with the character literal fallback path.
- Completed the literal pipeline (raw/byte/C strings, escape validation, prefix filtering) and 
  tightened shebang parsing semantics.
- Expanded lexer regression tests (keywords/operators, literal coverage, numeric suffix failures,
  lifetimes) to guard the new behavior.

2025-11-07
- Implemented the full string and character literal system (regular, byte, raw, byte-raw, C, raw-C)
  including escape/unicode handling and diagnostics for unterminated/invalid tokens.
- Added raw-string recovery at EOL, escape validation diagnostics, and supporting helpers within 
  the literal module.
