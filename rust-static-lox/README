Change Log
----------
2025-11-12
- Completed the generics/struct push by refactoring the AST (new `ast/mod.rs`, dedicated print
  modules, and split-out path definitions) so expanded tree output stays maintainable.
- Polished the Rust-like type pipeline—grouped-expression, generic, struct, and type parsers now
  share clearer helpers and emit better diagnostics across field shapes and nested arguments.
- Added dedicated attribute, path, and visibility parsers, hooked them into the entrypoint, and
  covered them with `core/lox/duck.lox` samples plus new diagnostic error kinds.
- Tightened lifetime and literal lexing (contextual keywords, escape handling, spans) and broadened
  regression tests to lock in the new edge-case coverage.

2025-11-11
- Unblocked tuple/group expression parsing with attribute propagation, AST printer updates, and
  real programs that mix inner/outer attributes inside nested tuples.
- Removed the duplicated AST monolith in favor of a modular `ast/mod.rs` + printer setup, giving
  `print_tree` richer output while keeping definitions in one place.
- Brought in the first full cut of Rust-style type + struct parsing (generic arguments, field
  initializers, path unification) and retired the old parser scaffolding.
- Hardened literal scanning by recognizing prefixed/raw string starters through a helper and by
  enforcing that shebangs only trigger in column zero.

2025-11-10
- Extended the expression parser through unary, factor, cast, shift, and bitwise layers, keeping 
  the AST updates and grouped-expression handling in sync.
- Fixed the lexer `match` helper so it no longer skips characters when matching punctuation-heavy 
  tokens.

2025-11-09
- Completed primary expression coverage by wiring identifiers, booleans, postfix operators, and 
  string/float literals between the lexer and parser.
- Refined literal scanning (float/integer unification, suffix guards, empty-line comment recovery)
  to harden the lexer’s edge cases.
- Polished developer feedback with severity color fixes plus refreshed BNF grammar notes and the 
  AST print tree output.

2025-11-08
- Added unified numeric literal suffix scanning (integers `u8`/`i32` etc. and floats `f32`/`f64`)
  across every base, plus diagnostics for malformed suffixes and reserved prefixes.
- Introduced lifetime lexing (`'a`, `'static`, `'_`) with invalid-number detection, integrating 
  it with the character literal fallback path.
- Completed the literal pipeline (raw/byte/C strings, escape validation, prefix filtering) and 
  tightened shebang parsing semantics.
- Expanded lexer regression tests (keywords/operators, literal coverage, numeric suffix failures,
  lifetimes) to guard the new behavior.

2025-11-07
- Implemented the full string and character literal system (regular, byte, raw, byte-raw, C, raw-C)
  including escape/unicode handling and diagnostics for unterminated/invalid tokens.
- Added raw-string recovery at EOL, escape validation diagnostics, and supporting helpers within 
  the literal module.
