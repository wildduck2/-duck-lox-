@duck-lox(rs)
============

This is the rust static typed language implementation of lox.

There is a [plan](./plan.md) for this language, so do not worry.

Change Log
----------
2025-11-01
- Expanded the grammar with tuple literals/expressions, tuple pattern destructuring, and unified handling for `let`/`const` declarations across lexer and parser.
- Introduced comprehensive pattern matching and lambda expression support, covering anonymous functions and match arms.
- Added parsing and diagnostic coverage for `mut`/`const` bindings, lambda declarations, and match statements, plus regression tests for these flows.
- Landed integration tests that exercise variable declarations, lambdas, and match constructs to validate the new parser paths.

2025-10-31
- Refined diagnostics to lazily load context from source files, updated span representation, and wired parser construction to operate on scanned tokens while adding synchronization/error recovery helpers.
- Added integration tests for the lexer to cover basic statements, keyword/literal handling, and invalid-character diagnostics via `cargo test -p lexer`.

2025-10-30
- Expanded the parser with recursive-descent utilities for expressions and introduced richer error reporting tied to the diagnostic engine.
- Updated lexer token kinds for boolean literals and adjusted runner wiring to pass scanned tokens into the parser.

2025-10-29
- Documented the diagnostic crate with a usage-oriented README and example output.
- Added targeted Rust doc comments to the lexer, covering lifecycle methods and token-specific lexers.
